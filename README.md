## Purpose of the project
This is my part of a group project for studies for subject "data visualization". The aim of the project was to create visualizations of chosen data, using different plots, where the user can customise shown content.

## Some of the charts

In the plot above we can see how riders have gained points thru whole season. We can specific season year select the riders to be shown.

This simple box plot above shows points scored on wet and dry track by the selected rider. In an easy way we can see if the is better on dry or wet track.
