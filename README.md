# MotoGP-data-visualization

## Purpose of the project
This is my part of a group project for studies for subject "data visualization". The aim of the project was to create visualizations of chosen data, using different plots, where the user can customise shown content. I'm a big fan of MotoGP and thought this is perfect dataset, where are a lot of possibilites to show interesting data.

# Some of the most interesting charts
